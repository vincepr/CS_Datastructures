# Binary Tree

## Usage (binary Tree)
- implementation of inary heaps
- Syntax trees (ex used by compiler and calculators)
- Treap - probabilistic Datastructure

## Binary Search Trees (BST)
A Special Tree, that also follows the Search Tree invariant:
- left subtree has smaller elmenets (than current node)
- right subtree has larger elements (than current node)

### Usage (Binary Search Tree)
- Implementation for Sets, Maps
- Red Black Trees
- AVL Trees
- Splay Trees

### Complexity (Binary Search Tree)
|  | Average | Worst |
|---|---|---|
| Insert | O(log(n)) | O(n) |
| Delte | O(log(n)) | O(n) |
| Remove | O(log(n)) | O(n) |
| Search | O(log(n)) | O(n) |

- Average case for statistically distributed values.
- worst case would be ex order data incoming in exactly the inverse way.
